# DevOps documentation
<!-- Replace all of the titles with relevant titles -->

This section contains all documentation relevant to DevOps procedures.

The devops content is divided into two sections:

* The [devops guide](guide/index.md), which describes common workflows for deployment and management of running instances in a tutorial format.
* The [devops manual](manual/index.md), which provides links and references to deployment configuration files, frameworks and deployment systems used etc.
