## How to use the time slider?

You can user the time slider for Historical Landsat Imagery as well as for Recent Nicfi Imagery.

### Use time slider for Historical Landsat Imagery

![Historical imagery](./img/Timesliderlandsat.gif)

Select the `Historical Imagery (Landsat)` checkbox, The slide bar represents a timeline of available historical imagery.

To view different time periods, click and drag the toggle on the slide bar. Move it left or right to navigate through time. As you move the toggle, the map canvas will update to display the corresponding imagery for that time period. Each increment on the slide bar represents a specific time period. Moving to the next or previous increment will show you how the landscape has changed over time.

**Using the Play Button:**

Look for the play button near the slide bar. Click the play button to automatically cycle through the historical imagery. This feature is excellent for visualising landscape changes over time without manual intervention.

**Activating the Loop Feature:**

Find the `Loop` checkbox next to the play button. Check this box if you want the playback to continuously loop through the imagery. When activated, the playback will restart from the beginning after reaching the most recent imagery.

## Use time slider for Recent Nicfi Imagery

![Nicif imagery](./img/Timeslidernicfi.gif)

Select the `Recent Imagery (Nicfi)` checkbox, The slide bar represents a timeline of available nicfi imagery.

To view different time periods click, and drag the toggle on the slide bar. Move it left or right to navigate through time. As you move the toggle, the map canvas will update to display the corresponding imagery for that time period. Each increment on the slide bar represents a specific time period. Moving to the next or previous increment will show you how the landscape has changed over time.
