# User documentation

This is the homepage for all user-related documentation.

The user content is divided into three sections:

- The [quickstart tutorial](quickstart/index.md) aims to get you familiar with the basics of the platform in around 5 minutes.
- The [user guide](guide/index.md) describes common workflows in a tutorial format.
- The [user manual](manual/index.md) describes each page of the user interface and what the various options on that page do.
